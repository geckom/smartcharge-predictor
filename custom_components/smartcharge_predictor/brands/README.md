# Brand Assets for Home Assistant

## Submitting Icons to Home Assistant Brands Repository

To display the icon on Home Assistant's "Add Integration" page, you need to submit the icon to the [Home Assistant Brands repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands).

### Steps:

1. **Prepare your icon files:**
   - **icon.png**: 128x128 pixels, square format
   - **logo.png**: 256x256 pixels, rectangular format (optional but recommended)
   - Both should have transparent backgrounds

2. **Fork and submit:**
   - Fork the [Home Assistant Brands repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands)
   - Navigate to `custom_integrations/smartcharge_predictor/`
   - Add your `icon.png` and `logo.png` files
   - Submit a pull request

3. **After approval:**
   - Once merged, the icon will automatically appear in Home Assistant's integration list
   - This may take a few days for the changes to propagate

## Current Icon

The `icon.svg` file in this directory can be converted to PNG format using any image editor:
- Recommended size: 128x128 pixels for icon.png
